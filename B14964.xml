            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What is there now wanting to the height of our happine≈ø≈øe, but the accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Peace, which cannot be with-held from us, if wee make but ≈øome tryall and proofe worthy of our zeale and good will?

Our dome≈øticke enemies are ≈øuch, who under colour and pretence of ray≈øing up the publike liberty, labour and endeavour to de≈øtroy it by inovation, and bury the ≈øame in their owne ambitious engro≈ø≈øing.

            <p>The wor≈øt cau≈øe that ever was in the world wanted not ≈øome pretence or other. There is nothing ≈øo like unto an Angell of light as a <hi>Daemon</hi> or Devill, nothing doth ≈øo counterfeyte, and appeare like unto the truth as fal≈øhood &amp; a lye. You have (my Lords) ≈øeene the ridiculous pretences of Count <hi>Henry de Bergh</hi> in tho≈øe Letters which hee hath ≈øent to her highne≈ø≈øe, to the States of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the declaration which he made to ≈øollicite the fidelity of ≈øoldiers and men of honour. You have ≈øeene I ≈øay, his foundation without foundation, upon the which he grounds his perver≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. But the di≈ølike and di≈øta≈øt which you have taken again≈øt his proceedings hath beene ≈øuch, and your loyalty and fidelity ≈øo commendable, that even to convince his felony, you have (with an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:176890:3"/>extraordinary affection, &amp; love to the good of the Countrey) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto the Prince farre greater ayde and helpe than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you had done. Moreover it is nece≈ø≈øary that be≈øides you, the world be ≈øatisfied, which oftentimes doth judge by the outward appearance, not knowing the truth of things, and that the ≈øame may ≈øee the truth di≈øcovered, le≈øt men be abu≈øed by the cunning ≈ølights and pretences where withall he hides the gro≈ø≈øene≈ø≈øe and ba≈øene≈ø≈øe of his trea≈øon. He begins his letter written to her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe with in≈øupportable and boldne≈ø≈øe without mea≈øure, pre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mo≈øt traytour-like bread in one hand, and a flinty ≈øtone in the other. He expo≈øeth his wicked de≈øignes with all ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion. Never I am ≈øure, was there any rebellion declared with more ≈øhamele≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe and impudency. After this his fayned Ceremony and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, he <hi>complaineth, that the Souldiers were withdrawne from his government, to the end that they might make him be the cau≈øe of their de≈øtruction.</hi> It is lawfull for a man to make his complaint but not perfidious. That which he ≈øayes is not truth, and the Letters of the Marqui≈øe <hi>De Sancte Croes</hi> doe te≈øtifie as much for he required no men from him, <hi>but onely beacu≈øe he judged that the enemy would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing on that ≈øide, leaving all to his owne choi≈øe and de≈øiring him to ≈øee the Bridge well guarded and provided before</hi> Venlo, <hi>to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the troupes to pa≈ø≈øe over ≈øafely which ≈øhould be ≈øeat to relieve the ≈øame.</hi> And put the ca≈øe, that which he affirmeth were true, if hee had beene well minded, and his intention good, he ought to have defended her government to the la≈øt man, and have kept him≈øelfe in the City of <hi>Gelder</hi> which is a ≈øtrong place, (as he had promi≈øed by Letters to her highne≈ø≈øe, and allowing that <hi>Venlo</hi> was able to be held) &amp; therein have imitated the genero≈øity of his Brother Count <hi>Frederick,</hi> who in the yeare 1597. defended him≈øelfe within the City <hi>Lingen,</hi> even to the extreamity, with onely three Companies of foote and one of Hor≈øe. But this, two dayes before the enemie did come before <hi>Venlo,</hi> called the Magi≈øtrates and told them, that the city would ≈øoon be be≈øieged, &amp; to take away the courage from the Citizens demon≈øtrated unto them the ≈ømall appearance and hope he had of defending the ≈øame. Wherefore hee excu≈øed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe from protecting of them, nay and be≈øides this being Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Province, ≈øaid he had other places to guard &amp; looke to,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176890:4"/>neverthele≈ø≈øe he pre≈øently made ha≈øt unto the City <hi>Gelder,</hi> from whence he departed pre≈øently accompanied onely with one ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or Companion, &amp; betooke him≈øelfe to <hi>Liege,</hi> there to put in execution the perfidiou≈øne≈ø≈øe which he had plodded a long time.</p>

The advice of the mo≈øt part of the Colonels was to open Trench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt trench, and weary out the enimie in ≈øuch ≈øort, that hee ≈øhould not bee able to di≈øquiet the be≈øieged, and ≈øo expect vntill the Autumne ≈øhould bee pa≈øt, and than the waters would cau≈øe him to depart of his owne accord, or at the lea≈øtwi≈øe bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained to for≈øake ≈øome quarter or other, by which meanes wee might haue a way opened to bring in Munition, and ≈øoldiers and nece≈ø≈øaries, as much as ≈øhould be required for the deliuerance of the City.
